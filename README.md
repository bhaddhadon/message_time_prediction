# message_time_prediction

# Main Idea
### 1) build a binary classification model to predict 'clicked', 'time of week' being one of the feature
### 2) Once the model is ready, since everything else is constant, the only degree of freedom is time to message
### 3) We then put in all possible hour of the week and pick only hour which product top probability of cliked
